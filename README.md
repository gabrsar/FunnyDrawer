# Just a Funny Exercise of Javascript Basics :)

Please, don't care about good practices, patterns, and others things that a professional code should have or care.
It's just for fun!

# Usage

Just open FunnyDrawer.html on your browser, or [click here](https://rawgit.com/gabrsar/FunnyDrawer/master/FunnyDrawer.html)

# Why?
Why not? I spent almost all my time codding professionally, with rules, making robust, reusable, clean and other things that you should do when code for your job.

It's for me, for funny, for relax. Just grab your keyboard and enjoy ;)
